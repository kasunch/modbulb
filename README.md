# modBulb - A modular light bulb for VLC
modBulb is an open source light bulb with a modular design that can be customized according to applicationâ€™s requirements.
modBulb allows users to generate baseband signals simply through an MCU or an FPGA where more sophisticated signal processing is required. 
Moreover, modBulb offers the convenience of reprogramming the MCU and FPGA wirelessly to the users. 

modBulb uses an energy efficient switching LED driving circuitry which makes modBulb usable beyond prototyping and research applications.
